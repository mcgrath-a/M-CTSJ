    <h2 id="section1">Project Description </h2>
        <p style = "font-family:'Poppins', sans-serif;font-size:20px;">
          My project is a short, interactive quiz-like game on micro-feminism inspired by a late-night <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@iamashleychaney/video/7350480639679925547">TikTok </a>(way past my bedtime). It harnesses the power of seemingly small, everyday actions to 
          challenge deep-seated capitalist and misogynistic ideologies.<b>**</b>If you do wish to play the game before reading this entire page, please skip to <a href="#section6">User flow and navigation guidance</a> to understand how that page works.

        <h2 id="section2">Motivation</h2>
        <p style = "font-family:'Poppins', sans-serif;font-size:20px;">
          After class discussions, sometimes I feel a sense of somberness, questioning whether I, as an individual, can genuinely make any significant impact or change 
          in the world—especially when confronting deeply entrenched capitalist, misogynistic, and racist ideologies. Despite hearing and feeling the passion that something
           needs to be done, I felt my voice or personal agency could not make a difference. What can I do to change the cycle? To combat these feelings of helplessness, I 
           realized that the key was to delve deeper into micro-feminism.   
        <br>
        <br>
          This unique interactive short game, viewed through an Intersectional Feminist lens, creatively disrupts traditional narratives. It demonstrates how individual actions can subvert entrenched power systems when applied in daily P.O.V. 
          scenarios. This game is an educational tool and an invitation to actively engage with feminist theories, connecting them to everyday practices. It aims to bridge the gap between 
          feminist theory and practical application. Reflecting on the TikTok that inspired this game, I'm grateful I stayed up past bedtime.

        <h2 id="section3">What is Microfeminism</h2>
        <p style = "font-family:'Poppins', sans-serif;font-size:20px;">
          While writing this text in Google Docs, the word "microfeminism" is flagged by my spell-check as incorrect. When I asked ChatGPT about "microfeminism," 
          it initially responded with limited information, indicating that this term is not widely recognized. However, this concept does exist and has been discussed 
          in various forms. Dating back to at least 2015, one of the earliest mentions I found is in <a href="https://miracharlotte.com/2015/10/04/on-micro-and-macrofeminism/">Mira Charlotte Krishnan's blog</a>, where she delves into the nuanced interplay between microfeminism and macrofeminism. 
          Mira Charlotte Jourdan (Krishnan) is a is a social entrepreneur and feminist activist, passionate about the lives of girls and women, early childhood development, and sustainable communities. 
        <br>
        In the blog "On Micro- and Macrofeminism," she explores the nuanced interplay between microfeminism and macrofeminism. Mira discusses how both personal and broader societal feminist actions are essential.
         She points out that micro-feminism involves individual experiences and daily interactions that reflect feminist values, like addressing everyday microaggressions and personal advocacy. Mira’s reflection 
         in her blog emphasizes that true feminist activism should not ignore the small, personal experiences of inequality and misogyny at home because they are foundational to the individual's feminist consciousness.
          She argues that overlooking these aspects can undermine the authenticity and integrity of one’s feminist stance. More recently, and I correlate this with the term's virality (exponential viralness) in the past months, more articles and 
          Op-eds have discussed micro-feminism; one in particular written by Ann Martin in Her.ie, an online news site targeted for Irish women, is titled <a href="https://her.ie/life/what-is-micro-feminism-603720">“What is micro-feminism? Fighting gender inequality in little ways” </a>
          discusses the concept of "micro-feminism" as an approach that emphasizes fighting gender inequality through small, everyday actions. This form of feminism is about recognizing and addressing the subtle and often 
          overlooked instances of sexism that occur in daily life, thereby promoting gender equality on a more personal and immediate scale. Martin highlights how these seemingly minor actions can collectively have a significant
           impact on the broader feminist movement.​

        <h2 id="section4">Technicality</h2>
        <p style = "font-family:'Poppins', sans-serif;font-size:20px;">
          This website has over 1,000 lines of code using programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is tailored to fit my creative vision, using programming resources like Stack Overflow, Google, and ChatGPT as needed for advanced tech support. 
         I hope that not only is my engagement with the course material evident but you (the audience) are immersed in the website as I have spent many hours making it tailored to my liking :)
         
        <br>
        <br>
  


    <h2 id="section2">Who and why </h2>

        <p style = "font-family:'Poppins', sans-serif;font-size:20px;">
          This project is designed to interlink the themes and insights from our class discussions with an innovative, 
          interactive format, focusing on the concept of micro-feminism. The intent is to empower players—students, educators,
           and anyone interested in feminist theories—to realize the significant impact of small daily actions against larger oppressive
            structures. I hope the innovation of using computer science and crossing that over with feminist theory shows that there are 
            truly no bounds in education, especially regarding the barrier of entry.
