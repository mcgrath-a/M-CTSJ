            By placing the woman supervisor's name before her boss, you engage in what Sara Ahmed calls a "Feminist Killjoy." 
            In her book, The Feminist Killjoy: The Radical Potential of Getting in the Way (2023), Ahmed argues that such small acts 
            can disrupt traditional power dynamics and challenge the entrenched patriarchal structures in our society. 
            Ahmed writes, <i>"More than ever, we need to 'get in the way,' to speak up and speak back, and to be inconvenient" </i>(Ahmed, 2023). 
            This approach asserts women’s presence and value in spaces where they are traditionally overlooked or undervalued. By reversing the 
            typical order of names, you symbolically elevate the visibility of those typically in the background, challenging the normative hierarchy 
            that prioritizes men in high positions. Additionally, incorporating the concept of hegemonic masculinity, which explains the social 
            mechanisms that reinforce men's dominance over women (or, in this case, their name before the women's) through culturally sanctioned 
            behaviors and beliefs, can deepen the understanding of why flipping the traditional naming order in professional settings is a subversive act.
             This concept has been pivotal in framing gender dynamics and interventions to promote gender equity, as discussed in the study on gender interventions. 
             Ahmed’s exploration of being a "Feminist Killjoy" directly challenges these hegemonic structures by promoting actions that interrupt the social 
             and professional norms perpetuating male dominance. In conclusion, this scenario shows how, in professional settings, illustrating how small, 
             deliberate actions can have a significant feminist impact.

      This common assumption aligns with traditional gender expectations, where professional 
      roles are often perceived as male-dominated. By referring to the doctor without using 
      singular gender pronouns you challenge the default male narrative. This helps reshape 
      expectations and promotes a more inclusive view of professional roles, supporting gender equity.

        In this scenario, you directly engage with Judith Butler’s concept of gender performativity. 
        In “ Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory,” Butler articulates that gender is not an inherent identity 
        but "the legacy of sedimented acts" that are neither "natural, cultural, nor linguistic." Essentially, Butler argues that gender is not something we are born
         with but something we perform and construct through our behaviors and social interactions.
        By intentionally flipping the expected gender of a doctor, you contribute to redefining these acts that form our 
        understanding of professional roles. Butler suggests that such individual acts "do work to maintain and reproduce systems of oppression" 
        but crucially adds that "oppression is not solely a consequence of these acts." This perspective highlights the complexity of gender dynamics, where changing deep-seated biases
         requires not just altering individual actions but transforming the broader 
        "hegemonic social conditions" that give rise to them. Now, you may be thinking  I am just one person!? I thought the same, too, but your decision in this scenario is an example of
         micro-feminism that, while small, serves as a critical part of the broader effort to challenge and dismantle the systemic nature of gender oppression. This nuanced understanding 
         stresses that while the act of NOT assuming a doctor is a man may seem minor, it is a strategic move within a larger framework aimed at altering the 
        conditions that sustain gender biases. Butler warns that focusing solely on individual actions without addressing underlying social conditions risks only touching upon the "indirect, 
        if not epiphenomenal, reflection of those conditions." Hence, tackling the broader social norms alongside individual behaviors is crucial to challenge and change gender biases effectively.

          potentially reinforcing gender-specific roles from a young age. From our discussion earlier in a previous scenario, Ahmed emphasizes the

            <br>
            In this scenario, as a teacher, you are actively engaging with Judith Butler’s theories on gender performativity. By choosing Option A, you challenge the traditional gender norms that often restrict such physical tasks to boys, fostering a classroom environment that promotes equality and disrupts ingrained gender roles from a young age. By allowing all students, regardless of gender, to participate in moving items, you encourage them to perform acts outside of those traditionally associated with their gender, thereby questioning and potentially reshaping these norms.
            <br>
            <br>
            Furthermore, Butler explains that these acts of gender are not just private performances but are inherently public and collective, stating that "repetition is at once a reenactment and reexperiencing of a set of meanings already socially established." In the classroom setting, inviting all students to engage in what might traditionally be considered 'masculine' tasks makes this action public and part of a collective experience, contributing to the "mundane and ritualized form of their legitimation." Challenging these norms in the educational environment fosters a space where gendered assumptions are questioned and actively dismantled, encouraging a more inclusive and equitable approach to all activities.

            Does it matter who moves and who doesn't? Yes, it matters a lot, in fact. Choosing not to step aside becomes a powerful instance of applying feminist principles in everyday situations. This decision challenges traditional public space dynamics and counters the subtle reinforcement of gender norms, particularly towards men.
            <br>
            <br>
            In her commentary for the National Review, Katherine Timpf discusses Beth Breslaw's informal experiment about gender dynamics on sidewalks. Titled "I ‘Walked Like a Man’ and Three Times As Many Women Ran into Me as Men," Timpf's piece explores the nuances of what Breslaw coined as "manslamming", a play on words from the very popular term “mansplaining,  the phenomenon where men, influenced by societal norms, are less likely to yield space on sidewalks to women. However, Timpf conducted her version of the experiment, which yielded different results, showing that three times as many women bumped into her as men. This finding challenges the notion that sidewalk dynamics are purely gender-based and invites readers to consider the complexity of social behaviors in public spaces.

            We will shift to the work of adrienne maree brown (yes, their name is lowercase intentionally), most notably known as a writer, activist, and facilitator informed by 25 years of social and environmental justice facilitation primarily supporting Black liberation. Her works, including Emergent Strategy and We Will Not Cancel Us, provide a theoretical framework for understanding the implications of such actions, like not moving out of the way on the sidewalk. brown describes emergence as noticing "how small actions and critical connections create complex systems that become ecosystems and societies" (Emergent Strategy, 2017). This concept parallels the choice in this scenario, where a seemingly minor act of holding one's ground contributes to a broader cultural shift towards gender equality and mutual respect in public spaces. brown critiques the pleasure derived from punitive measures and emphasizes the importance of fostering environments based on care and healing. In We Will Not Cancel Us, she argues against the satisfaction derived from punitive actions, suggesting instead that we should "invest in the pleasures that heal us rather than the pleasures that create more harm" (We Will Not Cancel Us, 44). This sentiment supports the decision to figuratively and literally walk your path without yielding, as it promotes a practice of non-punitive interaction that underscores mutual respect and coexistence rather than submission or dominance.

          <p> <b>Scenario #5</b> You are an officiant at a wedding ceremony. As the ceremony nears its conclusion, it's time for the couple to share a kiss. At rehearsal, they told you they did not prefer how you announced the kiss. How do you phrase this moment to challenge traditional gender roles and norms?

          </h3>
          <p class = "noselect"> Option A can easily be seen as the “Gold standard,” at least when it comes to heteronormative wedding ceremonies. This traditional phrasing reinforces historical gender roles and norms, where one party, typically the groom, initiates the action, implying a transfer of authority or permission. By altering the phrase to "You may now kiss each other," you challenge the traditional notion of male authority and promote a sense of mutual respect and equality.

              Suppose you ever decide to be an officiant at a wedding. Use this scenario as your first lesson; choosing Option B: "You may now kiss each other," is a significant step towards challenging traditional gender roles and norms; it doesn't make the ceremony any less memorable by swapping a few words out. This phrasing promotes a sense of equality and mutual consent, moving away from the traditional, gendered directive, "You may now kiss the bride," which typically implies male initiation and dominance in the act.

              Judith Lorber, in "Believing is Seeing: Biology as Ideology," emphasizes that what is often seen as natural or predestined by biology is, in fact, a cultural destiny. She argues, "Not biology, but culture, becomes destiny," highlighting how we perform and interpret gender, which is learned and perpetuated through cultural practices (Lorber, 1993). By choosing an egalitarian phrase like "You may now kiss each other," you underscore that actions typically bound by gender can be transformed, supporting a broader cultural shift towards recognizing and practicing gender equality.

              This approach not only aligns with feminist theoretical frameworks but also actively contributes to the ongoing effort to shape a society where gender norms do not dictate the limits of personal expression or action. In this way, the wedding becomes a site of subtle yet powerful societal change, reflecting a move towards more inclusive and equitable gender practices.
